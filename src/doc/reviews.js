      'Professional staff, and a great clinic that produces effective results. My experience at Cadmen Clinic was incredible from start to finish. After 3 sessions of PRP, my thinning hair in the crown area had regrown as well as my hairline! The nurses were very nice and easy to talk to. I also got a Botox treatment to get rid of some fine lines and wrinkles. I would highly recommend this clinic.'

    review:
      'I was looking for some youthful rejuvenation as I approached my 40th birthday last week. The nurse at Cadmen Clinic brought my mojo back to life with her expert and skilled injection of dermal fillers. She listened to what I wanted to improve and suggest a treatment that she then administered with the utmost precision and care for a balanced natural look.'
